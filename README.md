# GDP and Productivity of Indian Cities

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the GDP and productivity of cities in India, providing a comprehensive understanding of economic performance across urban regions. By combining an interactive Power BI dashboard and a Streamlit web application, the project enables users to explore economic data from a variety of perspectives, making it easier to understand the complex economic landscape of Indian cities. It incorporates key metrics such as GDP, sectoral employment, and other economic indicators to offer detailed insights.

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the GDP and productivity of various cities in India, explore their economic trends, and provide users with easy-to-use tools for visualizing and comparing data. By developing a Power BI dashboard and a Streamlit web app, this project aims to simplify complex economic data and make it more accessible to different audiences, such as policymakers, analysts, and the general public. The application allows for the visualization of city-specific data, comparisons across cities, and real-time GDP calculation.

## Key Features

1. **Interactive Power BI Dashboard**:
   - The Power BI dashboard allows users to interact with the data visually, with easy-to-read graphs and charts.
   - Users can view city-specific data, such as GDP, sectoral employment, and GDP per capita.
   - The dashboard includes several types of visualizations:
     - **Bar and Line Charts** for displaying GDP trends over time.
     - **Pie Charts** for sectoral contributions to GDP.
     - **Geographical Maps** for comparing regional disparities in GDP and productivity.
   - Filters enable users to zoom into specific cities, states, or sectors to analyze trends at a granular level.
   - The Power BI dashboard supports the display of comparative analyses, allowing users to compare GDP and productivity across multiple cities or time periods.

2. **Streamlit Web Application**:
   - The Streamlit web application serves as an interactive front-end for exploring the same data available in the Power BI dashboard.
   - Users can search and filter cities based on specific criteria such as GDP, population, and sectoral contributions.
   - The app features a **GDP calculator** that allows users to input parameters (e.g., population, sectoral growth rates) and calculate the projected GDP of a city.
   - The web application provides a real-time, dynamic experience where users can compare cities and view their economic indicators side by side.
   - A comparison tool allows users to analyze multiple cities at once, viewing metrics such as GDP, employment distribution, and growth trends.

3. **Data on Indian Cities**:
   - The dataset used in this project includes detailed economic data on over 100 cities across India.
   - Key data points include:
     - **GDP**: Gross Domestic Product for each city.
     - **GDP per capita**: Economic output per person.
     - **Sectoral Employment**: Employment figures categorized by major sectors (agriculture, industry, services).
     - **Population**: The total population of each city.
     - **Economic Growth Rate**: The annual growth rate of each city’s GDP.
   - The data is collected from reliable government and economic sources, including the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) and other regional and national economic databases.

4. **City-Specific Analysis**:
   - The Power BI dashboard and Streamlit web application enable users to drill down into city-specific data, providing an in-depth analysis of the economic performance of individual cities.
   - Users can explore how various cities contribute to India’s GDP, compare sectoral employment figures, and gain insights into the economic dynamics of specific regions.
   - City-wise analysis helps uncover patterns, such as which cities are leading in terms of productivity or which sectors are most dominant in each city.

5. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Both the Power BI dashboard and Streamlit application offer tools for comparing cities based on various metrics. Users can compare GDP, sectoral contributions, and employment figures across different regions and time periods.
   - The **city comparison tool** in Streamlit allows users to select multiple cities and analyze their economic data side by side, which is particularly useful for identifying trends and disparities in urban development.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: Used for creating dynamic visualizations and an interactive dashboard. Power BI enables easy data exploration and the creation of complex visual reports.
- **Streamlit**: A Python-based framework for building web applications. Streamlit powers the web interface, providing an interactive, user-friendly experience for analyzing the data.
- **Python**: Python is used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. These libraries help process raw data into meaningful insights.
- **GitHub**: The project is managed and versioned using GitHub, ensuring code integrity and enabling collaboration. GitHub also provides a platform for sharing the project with others.
- **SQL** (Optional): If the data is stored in a database, SQL can be used for querying and fetching relevant data for the analysis.

## Data Sources

The data for this project comes from multiple trusted sources:
- **Government Databases**: Various state and municipal government sources that provide information on population, employment, and economic activities.
- **Public Data Sets**: Open data platforms and repositories that share economic data for Indian cities.

## How to Use

### Power BI Dashboard:
- The Power BI dashboard provides a detailed view of the economic data and allows users to interact with multiple visualizations.
- **Navigating the Dashboard**:
  - **Filters**: Use filters to narrow down the data based on cities, sectors, or time periods.
  - **Hover over visualizations** to see city-specific data in more detail.
  - **Compare Cities**: Use the comparison feature to analyze multiple cities across various economic indicators.
  - **Geo Maps**: View geographic visualizations to understand regional disparities in GDP and sectoral employment.

### Streamlit Web Application:
- **City Selection**: Select a city from the dropdown menu to see its GDP, sectoral employment, and other key metrics.
- **GDP Calculator**: Input values such as population and sectoral contributions to calculate the GDP of a city.
- **Comparing Cities**: Use the comparison tool to select multiple cities and view their economic data side by side. This is helpful for identifying trends and disparities.
- **Real-time Updates**: As you adjust inputs in the Streamlit app, the data and visualizations are updated dynamically to reflect the latest values.
